ipv4:
use of 32 bits
some ip addresses are reserved for events such as maintenence of routing tables, multicast tables, or operation under failure modes
three ranges of ips reserved for private networks
class A networks reserved for loopback, no packets should appear outside the network

Fragmentation: When a router receives a packet, it examines the destination address and determines the outgoing interface to use and that interface's MTU. 
If the packet size is bigger than the MTU, and the Do not Fragment (DF) bit in the packet's header is set to 0, then the router may fragment the packet.

Reassembly is when fragmented ids are read and the original data payload is read and wrote.
